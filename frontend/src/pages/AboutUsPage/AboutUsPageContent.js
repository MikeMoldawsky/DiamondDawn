      Diamond Dawn was created by a team of forward-thinking individuals from
      various fields who share a common set of values.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all believe that <b>decentralization</b> is key to the Internet’s
      survival.
    </p>
    <p>
      We look forward to the day when the robust technology behind Web3 and NFTs
      will disrupt most industries as we know them today, resulting in a shift
      in “power” from corporations to individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diamond Dawn was specifically architectured to demonstrate how
      decentralized technology can create a <b>REAL-LIFE</b> impact.

      Decentralized systems are designed to be secure, public, and trustless -

    <p>
      <b>NFT is a disruptive, decentralized technology.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, you can truly own an asset without trusting in a third
      party that can impose its own rules at will - and it’s 100% publicly
      verifiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many early and current NFT projects still feature centralized aspects. At
      Diamond Dawn, we believe in and deliver 100% decentralization (see

        The ongoing breakthrough of NFT tech enables us to perform
        once-impossible feats. With NFTs, you truly own assets, track provenance
        and verify publicly - with zero third-party reliance.

          NFT technology will disrupt all traditional technologies in remarkable

        Right now, the countless certifications of a $100B diamond industry are
        kept in paper ledgers held by major players - can their transparency,
        provenance and record really be considered 100% tamper-free?

        What do you think the certification of industries like the diamond

    <p>Right now, many people disregard digital value.</p>
    <p>
      <b>However, most of the world’s value cannot be touched.</b>

    <p>
      As NFT technology continues to rise, more begin to reevaluate traditional
      assumptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it really the case that digital creation has no value - or is that
      thinking simply because we had no way of truly owning online assets?
    </p>
    <p>
      With NFT technology permitting true online ownership, digital items can
      now be just as scarce and valuable as diamonds are in the physical realm.

    <p>
      Nobody can copy-paste a new NFT into existence, and
      right-click-image-saving won’t help when it comes to trying to sell it.
      The only way forward is to demonstrate the full potential of NFT
      technology…
