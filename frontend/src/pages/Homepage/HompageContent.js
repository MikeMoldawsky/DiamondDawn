      For thousands of years, they have been the ultimate symbol of wealth and abundance, worshiped and fought over by emperors for their sparkle and beauty.

      Under immense pressure and scorching heat over billions of years, deep below the earth’s surface, a marvel of nature is formed. The strongest, most enduring material on Earth. <b>A diamond.</b>
      <br />
      We crown royalty with diamonds, hand them down as family heirlooms, and swear our eternal love with them. A single diamond, smaller than a pea, can cost tens of millions of dollars.

      Unfortunately, the recent rise of lab-grown diamonds makes it impossible to distinguish a ‘real’ diamond from a man-made one. Even experts use special equipment to set them apart.
      <br />
      In addition, it’s known that big diamond companies are keeping vast quantities of diamonds hidden away in massive vaults, controlling the circulating supply of the diamond market.

      What makes a thing valuable?
      <br />
      With the recent rise of NFT technology, the lines between the physical and virtual worlds have become blurred, and the definition of value has become a subject of debate.
      <br />
      Nowadays, artworks that are 100% digital are being sold for tens of millions of dollars and auctioned by world-renowned auction houses such as Christie’s and Sotheby’s.
      <br />
      Who would have imagined, even as little as a few years ago, that it would be possible for a digital creation to be equally (or even more) valuable than its physical counterpart?

      Diamond Dawn is a blockchain social experiment that pushes this concept to the limit.
      <br />
      <br />
      For the first time in history, collectors will have the choice to create their own digital diamond on the blockchain and, at the end of their journey, face the ultimate decision -  <b>burn</b> their NFT and transform it into a physical diamond, or <b>keep</b> their diamond digital forever.
      <br />
      <br />
      Will collectors stand by their past notions of the physical being more valuable, or follow their confidence in the blockchain as the future?
      <br />
      <br />
      What do YOU believe? What do YOU value?
      The results will be visible for all to see on the blockchain forever…

        <b>The final choice is yours to make.</b>
