        For thousands of years, they have been the ultimate symbol of wealth and

        Under immense pressure and scorching heat over billions of years, deep
        below the earth’s surface, a marvel of nature is formed. The strongest,

        We crown royalty with diamonds, hand them down as family heirlooms, and
        swear our eternal love with them. A single diamond, smaller than a pea,
        can cost tens of millions of dollars.

        Unfortunately, the recent rise of lab-grown diamonds makes it impossible
        to distinguish a ‘real’ diamond from a man-made one. Even experts use
        special equipment to set them apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, it’s known that big diamond companies are keeping vast
        quantities of diamonds hidden away in massive vaults, controlling the
        circulating supply of the diamond market.

          So, if the diamond’s supply is unknown, and we can now produce them
          ourselves, how can we evaluate the actual worth of a physical diamond?

        With the recent rise of NFT technology, the lines between the physical
        and virtual worlds have become blurred, and the definition of value has
        become a subject of debate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, artworks that are 100% digital are being sold for tens of
        millions of dollars and auctioned by world-renowned auction houses such
        as Christie’s and Sotheby’s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who would have imagined, even as little as a few years ago, that it
        would be possible for a digital creation to be equally (or even more)
        valuable than its physical counterpart?

        Diamond Dawn is a <b>blockchain social experiment</b> that pushes this
        concept to the limit.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first time in history, collectors will create their digital
        diamond on the blockchain and, at the end of their journey, face the
        ultimate decision - <b>burn</b> their NFT and transform it into a
        physical diamond, or <b>keep</b> their diamond digital forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will collectors stand by their past notions of the physical being more
        valuable, or follow their confidence in the blockchain as the future?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What do YOU believe? What do YOU value?</b>
        <br />
        The results will be visible for all to see on the blockchain forever…
        <br />
        The final choice is yours.
