      We expect our NFTs to live forever. Even 333 years from now, we expect
      them to exist and remain the same.
    </p>
    <p>But can an NFT truly live forever?</p>
    <p>
      Most web3 projects store their NFTs on centralized servers that are under
      their control. This means they can change your NFT or, even worse - delete
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>NFTs should be 100% under your control.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      For an NFT to truly live forever, it must be immune to time, funding, and
      people. This is exactly why an NFT must live on decentralized systems.
    </p>
    <p>Systems that are timeless, just like diamonds.</p>

      For an NFT to survive the test of time,{" "}

    </p>
    <p>An NFT is made up of 3 main components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Smart Contract - a piece of code that keeps track of your ownership (and
        more).
      </li>

        Metadata - a piece of text that represents additional information about
        your NFT (e.g., its name, description, and attributes).{" "}
      </li>
      <li>
        File - a file that is referenced by your NFT’s metadata. Usually, this
        file will comprise your NFT visuals.

      chosen correctly, can surpass the test of time. These systems are secure,
      public, and cannot be manipulated by human intervention they are
      trustless.

      Most projects store the NFT’s metadata on centralized servers or
      decentralized file systems like IPFS. If they go down, your metadata isn’t
      available, and your NFT is basically gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Your NFT will NOT show up on websites such as OpenSea.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of that, Diamond Dawn’s metadata lives entirely on the Ethereum
      blockchain (on-chain) and is maintained by the smart contract itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even we, the creators of this project, can manipulate your DD NFT.

      Arweave is a decentralized file system that offers a pay-once model for

      IPFS has a “Garbage Collector” process that periodically deletes files to
      free up disk space.{" "}

    <p>
      To keep your files on IPFS, you must continually pay for them to remain
      intact - this mechanism is known as “pinning” your file.

    <p>Who will pay for Diamond Dawn pinning 333 years from now?</p>

      As we couldn't answer this question, we chose the Arweave network as the
      storage solution for Diamond Dawn’s files.
