        <h1 id="team">THE TEAM</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Diamond Dawn was created by a team of forward-thinking individuals
          from various fields who share a common set of values. And that’s the
          magic word of this entire endeavor: Value.Together, we aim to push
          boundaries - both those of the web3 world and the ones ingrained in
          our mind as ‘beliefs’. Although the goal of the project is to generate
          new insights, encourage risk-taking, and raise questions like ‘what
          does value mean to you?’, it is the journey and participation in
          Diamond Dawn where the real rewards lie. This is a first-of-its-kind
          NFT project and social experiment in one,  that not only blurs lines
          between the virtual and physical, but also where the end result relies
          entirely on the choices made by the participant. Those who will be
          selected to participate will be pioneers, entering an unknown
          experience that will challenge, redefine, and change the way they view
          ‘value’.

          a transforming force for most industries, digital communities, and how

        <h2>Aviva Moldawsky - Diamond Art Designer</h2>
        <p className="text">
          Born to diamond merchants, Aviva was exposed, from a young age,  to
          both the harsh world of trade and negotiation and the fascinating
          world of exquisite beauty contained within the stones themselves. A
          world where, to this day, deals are closed not with a contract, but
          with a handshake and the word ‘luck’.  A highly-respected name in the
          world of diamonds, the Moldawsky family has supplied stones to
          Tiffany’s, Sterling, JC Penny, and more of  the largest firms in the
          world. As a diamond designer, Aviva helps her clients choose the rough
          stone, knowing which stone will yield the most desirable end result,
          and oversees the entire design process that will best fit her
          customer’s personality and style - from raw material all the way to
          the box in which it is delivered.
