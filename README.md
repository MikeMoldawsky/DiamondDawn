# Diamond Dawn

Diamond Dawn is a proof-of-concept demonstrating the ability to trade real physical diamonds over the blockchain. This project aims to address three major problems faced by the diamond industry:

1. **No Price Discovery**: Lack of transparency in determining the market price of diamonds.
2. **Certification Fraud**: Centralized control of diamond certifications, leading to potential fraud. Storing certifications on a public ledger restores consumer trust.
3. **Provenance**: Ensuring the origin of diamonds, preventing the trade of conflict or blood diamonds.

The immutable nature of blockchain technology ensures that certifications cannot be altered or manipulated once recorded on the blockchain. The NFT certification is independent of the certification company's security, storage choices, or financial stability, ensuring lasting integrity.
